# Git Workflow Best Practices

This document demonstrates the proper Git workflow we should follow for all future changes.

## Why We Need Pull Requests

Even in solo development, PRs provide:
- **Code review history**: Track what changed and why
- **Testing validation**: CI runs before merging
- **Rollback capability**: Easy to revert specific features
- **Professional standards**: Industry best practices

## Current Status Analysis

### What We've Done (Direct to Main):
- ✅ Fixed port configuration issues
- ✅ Added project management features
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive labeling
- ✅ Set up CI/CD and automation

### What We Haven't Done (PR Workflow):
- ❌ No pull request reviews for manual changes
- ❌ No feature branch isolation
- ❌ No pre-merge testing validation

## Proper Workflow Going Forward

### 1. Feature Development
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/issue-number-description
# Make changes
git add -A
git commit -m "Clear commit message"
git push origin feature/issue-number-description
gh pr create --title "Title" --body "Description"
```

### 2. Review and Merge
- Review changes in GitHub
- Ensure CI passes
- Merge via GitHub UI
- Delete feature branch

### 3. Cleanup
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/issue-number-description
```

This workflow ensures quality and provides audit trails for all changes.
